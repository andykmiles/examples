addsToK: -6
This function can only deal with distinct elements of the list – addsToK(6, [1,2,3]) does not yield true for 3+3.
Style: -4
Careful with syntax – parentheses and curly brackets do very different things and are not interchangeable.

Your solution is a little convoluted, and in the end converting to set causes you to lose a lot of data
