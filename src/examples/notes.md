3. Write a function, called mixedString, that takes a word string and computes a list of all words generated by a single swap of letters in the word. (20 points) For example dog should return ['odg', 'god', ‘dgo'] (notice that letters are only swapped with their immediate neighbors only, i.e. you don’t have ‘ogd’)


dogdog:
odg
god
dgo



longer:
rlonge
olnger
nogerl
gnerlo
egrlon


def mixedString(word, part = 0):
    letters = {}
    for count, letter in enumerate(phrase):

letters[count] =

addsToK: -6
This function can only deal with distinct elements of the list – addsToK(6, [1,2,3]) does not yield true for 3+3.

Style: -4
Careful with syntax – parentheses and curly brackets do very different things and are not interchangeable.

setComp: -6
Your solution is a little convoluted, and in the end converting to set
 causes you to lose a lot of data
